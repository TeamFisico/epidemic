# Epidemic simulation
This project represents the solution which we, Niccol√≤ Zanotti and Filippo Pretolani, two Physics Undegraduates studying at
University of Bologna, gave to our University Programming Course [final assignment][1].
We collaborated on writing the source code found in this repository except for, of course, external libraries code
(found in [extern](extern) subdirectory).

The project is made up of 2 main parts:

1. Using the known SEIR model to determine the spread of an epidemic, given initial conditions

2. Simulating the evolution of an epidemic, given simulation parameters

In the first part, given critical parameters, the evolution of the various states of the epidemic can be obtained
through two different numerical methods to solve differential equations: [Euler][1] method and [Runge-Kutta 4-th
order][4] method. To know more about this part see [here](include/SEIR.md).

Regarding the second part, namely, the actual simulation, we looked for a both realistic and reasonably complex 
statistical model to build our simulation on. We ,thus, largely based our work on [SMOOTH: A simple way to model human
mobility][2] paper, which we thought would contain the desired approach. 
To get a better grasp on how the simulation works see [here](include/Simulation.md).

## Dependencies
- [Lyra][lyra] (submodule)
- [Doctest][doct] (submodule)
- [SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org/) (required)
- [Root](https://root.cern) (required)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) (required)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Building
Make sure all the required dependencies are installed on your machine and fully working.

First of all, clone the repository locally:
```shell
#clone the released branch of the repository
git clone -b main --single-branch https://gitlab.com/Feyn-23/epidemic.git 
#enter the repository
cd epidemic
```
To facilitate the user, building scripts are available inside `scripts` project subdirectory.

Then you can either run the script in the script folder:
```shell
#from the cloned repository directory
cd scripts
#run the script
./quick-build.sh
```
or you can build directly:
```shell
#create and enter a build directory
mkdir build && cd build
#prepare to build files in release mode
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
#if you want to build every app
make
#if you want to build a specific app
make appname
```
Instead of building files using a single core, one can take advantage of the other available cores on the machine to
speed up the building process. To do that, it's sufficient to add `-jN` option at build time, N being equal to the number
of available machine cores plus 1: 

```shell
# for a quad-core machine
make sim-graphics -j 4
```

The available executable applications(CMake targets) are the following:

| App name     | Purpose                                                       |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------  |
| seir         | Solve the SEIR differential equation using a numerical method |
| sim          | Simulate an epidemic, without graphical output                |
| sim-graphics | Simulate an epidemic, with graphical evolution                |

At the end of every application run, a Root Canvas with the graphs will open

### Notes
`Lyra` and `doctest` library are linked to this project through `git submodules` tool. \
CMake should be able to initialize the submodules and set recursive update at the first build of the project, thanks to a module 
located in the base [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt), avoiding the user having to execute
```shell
 git submodule update --init --recursive
```
Anyway, if having troubles with properly initializing this project submodules, have a look at [this][submod] website, addressing
possible problems.


On certain devices, CMake might not be able to detect ROOT installation. If that is the case, the problem can be solved by manually specifying the
path to your ROOT installation, setting the CMake Variable ROOT_DIR at build time:
```shell
cmake -B path-to-build-dir -S path-to-source -DROOT_DIR="path-to-ROOT-installation"
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## User Input
The applications built by this project collect user input through command line arguments. 
We chose the command line parser libray [Lyra][lyra] to handle this task.
The value of an input variable can be set at execution time by referring to one of its names, that is,
a `char` following a short dash(`-`) or a `string` following a long dash(`--`). \
Therefore, the command to pass the value of two generic input variables named respectively `--var1` and `-v`
is the following:
```shell
./appname -var1 value_of_var1 -v value_of_v
```
Clearly, each application has its own input variables. 
The following tables show the available input options
for each application(an empty cell means the variable doesn't have a second name):

Lyra offers a help interface consisting of a summary of all input variables with relative names and descriptions
which can be accessed simply by specifying `-h` or `--help` at execution time.

Of course the user has not to pass all these variables to run the program; there are optionals which can be
default chosen, and some which have to be specified. 
The following examples show some of the possible combinations of input variables, choosing,when available, the longer name and omitting
variables values, just for the sake of clarity:
```shell
#app: seir
exec  --default 1                                                #default values
exec --method --people --alpha --beta --gamma --time              
exec --method --alpha --beta --gamma --time -S -E -I -R         
exec --method --people --time
```
```shell
#app: sim
exec  --default 1                                              #default values
exec --people --clust --loc --alpha --beta --gamma --time      #input clusters and locations 
exec --people --clust --alpha --beta --gamma --time            #input only cluster
exec --people --loc --alpha --beta --gamma --time              #input only locations
exec --clust -loc --time -S -E -I -R --time                    #do not use default S,E,I,R ratio
```
```shell
#app: sim-graphics
exec  --default 1                                              #default values
exec --people --clust --loc --alpha --beta --gamma             #input clusters and locations
exec --people --clust --alpha --beta --gamma                   #input only cluster
exec --people --loc --alpha --beta --gamma                     #input only locations
exec --clust -loc --time -S -E -I -R                           #do not use default S,E,I,R ratio
```
Note that , in order for the parsing to occur correctly, the `S`,`E`,`I`,`R` _group_ of parameters need to be specified at 
the end of the parameters list(see [input validation][inp-val]). \
The standard parameters used when  `default_sim` is setted are the ones in [parameters.hpp](include/simulation/parameters.hpp).

### Input validation
All input values are subject to validity conditions, some more restrictive than others.
Our major source of understanding about reasonable parameters values came from the graphical simulation:
testing multiple times in a variety of conditions allowed us to get a good grasp in this sense(see [testing][test]).
We decided not to put tight constraints on S,E,I,R values since the cases where they are supposed to assume
weird values are not realistic.

Regarding *sim* and *sim-graphics* apps we defined some constraints:

- For the combined value of clusters and locations in the simulation area to be valid, the minimum
  number of locations per cluster has to be **10**, but,as a rule, should be more;
- The number of clusters has to be less than **40**;
- The Side has to be at least equal to half the number of locations;
- The total population has to at least be **100** times the number of clusters, but should be much higher;
- The parameters alpha, beta and gamma have to be higher than 0 but smaller than 1, but they should be close to 0;
- The total population has to be higher than the total number of locations;

### Default values
`seir` default parameters:
| Parameters    | Default value   |
| ------------ | ------------------|
| people = [S, E, I, R] | 25000 = [990000,3000,5000,2000] |
| alpha | 0.035 |
| beta | 0.15 |
| gamma | 0.015 |

`sim` and `sim-graphics` default parameters:

| Parameters    | Default value   |  Suggestions          |
| ------------ | ------------------|------------------  |
| people = [S, E, I, R] | 25000 = [23750,750,375,125] | We suggest not going too high with the number of people as it will slow the simulation a lot; another suggestion would be to start with a good number of infected, since an excessively small number won't effectively spread the virus |
| clusters          | 10                | We suggest to have at least 5 clusters and maximum 20 of them, but other values should still give acceptable results | 
| locations | 1500 | We suggests at least 50 locations for cluster and not more than 300 per clusters, other values are possible but will probably give pointless results | |
| Side | 1000 | We suggest the side to be from 500 to 2000, as value too small are too cramped, and values too high need a careful and very difficult choice of parameters  |
| alpha | 0.05 | We suggest a similar value to this parameter, since a too high value ( > 0.2) will make this parameter pointless, while a value too low will make the simulation too unnecessary long |
| beta | 0.04 | We suggest a similar value to this parameter, since a high value( > 0.15) will make the epidemic very fast, while a too low will make it not spread |
|gamma | 0.015 | We suggest a similar value to this parameter, since a too high( > 0.15) value will make the epidemic end very fast, while a too low values will make it too long |

The three last parameter are the most sensible, a slight change to one of these will skew the results a lot.

## Running
In case the user is running a Linux disto on a Windows machine through WSL, make sure the Xserver is running as it is required for every application.  
All the built apps will be in the *epidemic/{BUILD_DIRECTORY}/apps* directory.
Where the *{BUILD_DIRECTORY}* is *sim_build* in case you used the script 
```shell
#from the epidemic directory enter the apps directory
cd {BUILD_DIRECTORY}/apps
#run the application you want to run
./appname -parameters
````
Where the parameters are the one seen in [User Input][input].

### Output

Every app will output the resulting data in "*appname.txt*" and the graphics in a root file "*appname.root*".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Tests
The testing strategy adopted for this project was _Unit testing_. To this aim, we made use of the header library
[doctest][doct]. \
Testing is enabled in Debug mode in cmake; so if you want to run a test you just need to build and run it,
or, alternatively, run the script:
```shell
#from the epidemic directory, enter the script directory
cd scripts
#and run the script
./testing.sh
#you can then go to the test_build directory and run the test
cd ../test_build && ./testname
```
Or manually
```shell
#from the epidemic directory create and enter a build directory
mkdir build && cd build
#prepare to build file in debug mode
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```shell
#build the test
make testname
#run the test
cd tests && ./testname
#or
./tests/testname
```
The tests are:

| App name      | function                                                                                   |
| ------------  | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| test1         | Test if `S + I + E + R` remain costant when solving the SEIR system                        |
| test2         | Test if both `Simulation::clean_path` and `Simulation::clean_cluster_path` works correctly  |
| test3         | Check if the generation of a `Simulation` object works correctly                              |

### Testing during development

The project was tested to work with `-Wall -Wextra -fsanitize=address` compiler options. \
During development we used other ways to test if our program was working correctly:
* We used various `asserts` statements that allowed us to check if the various functions where working
correctly.
* **fsanitize-address**, which helped us to find and correct various development choices that 
  we made and that were leading to various errors.
* The graphical interface which helped us as we could see if the various functions
  connected to world generation, to people movement and to the spreading
  of the virus where working as expected.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Code formatting

This repository contains a [.clang-format](.clang-format) file with the chosen formatting style. \
Thanks to an imported [CMake Module](cmake/ClangFormat.cmake), it is possible to format all the code simply by 
executing the following command
```shell
#the build files have already been generated
make clangformat    
```


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Additional Notes

It's possible to change other values of the simulation modifying them in `parameters.hpp` [file](include/simulation/parameters.hpp). \
These values are tied to how we structured the simulation, so we suggest to change the values only if
properly understanding where and how those values are used.
